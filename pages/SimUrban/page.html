<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
I am working on a computer game for people such as Transportation Engineers, Urban Planners, and citizens who want to learn about the design of urban systems such as infrastructure networks.
</p>

<h2> Process </h2>

<p>
FIXME: Make an illustration for my process on this one.

<h2> User Research </h2>

<h3> Written Feedback </h3>
<ul>
<li>People do not like computational limitations.</li>
<li>People only want to focus on the details that matter to them.</li>
<li>People like the ability to rapidly experiment and then undo actions.</li>
<li>People desire a streamlined, accessible, rich in feedback and fun such as in Rollercoaster Tycoon.</li>
<li>People donâ€™t like wasting time. They want to see action following from their actions.</li>
<li>Some people have learned life lessons through playing with simulations, such as learning tradeoffs in Oregon Trail that have influenced their real world hiking behaviors.</li>
<li>Navy simulations mimicked real life, which allowed people to take real life actions in a situation as if they had prior experience. Something about the immersive and engaging experience can make simulations more memorable than facts and teaching alone.</li>
<li>People like the ability to make horrendously bad decisions and see what will happen through the safety of a simulation.</li>
<li>Portability is important. That is why internet simulations may be more accessible than desktop simulations and physical installations.</li>
<li>Use non-outdated technology, because a great simulation is useless if nobody can use it.</li>
</ul>
